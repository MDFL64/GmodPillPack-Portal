GmodPillPack-Portal
============

This is the Portal Pill Pack addon. It allows you to change into creatures and machines from Portal 1 and 2.

You must have the base pack installed as well as at least one of these games.

Download the current "stable" version from the Steam Workshop. This is the "bleeding edge" development version.

Feel free to contribute to this or make your own packs. Please model custom packs after this or one of the other addon packs.
